# Javaquiz 

I created this web application learning how to manipulate and utilize DOM elements via JavaScript and as an introduction to the use of the browser's local storage.

Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:

As a a coding bootcamp student.

I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.

So that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

So I can save and view High Scores after. 

BUILT WITH:
JavaScript
HTML
